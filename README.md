# Infinite Scroll

This repository demonstrates an **Infinite Scroll** feature, which dynamically loads additional content as the user scrolls down a webpage. It's a widely used technique in modern web development to create seamless, user-friendly interfaces.

## Features

- **Dynamic content loading**: Automatically fetches and appends new content without refreshing the page.
- **Efficient performance**: Optimized for smooth scrolling and quick response times.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for various use cases, such as loading images, articles, or data entries.

## Demo

[Live Demo](#) (Add your live demo link here, if available.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohdAahil01/infiinte_scroll.git
   cd infiinte_scroll
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the infinite scroll in action.

## Usage

### File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the project.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file implementing the infinite scroll logic.

### How It Works

1. Initially, a predefined set of data is displayed.
2. As the user scrolls near the bottom of the page, the `scroll` event triggers a function to fetch and display more data.
3. The content is appended dynamically, creating an endless scrolling experience.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior by modifying the `script.js` file:
- Change the data source (API endpoint, JSON file, etc.).
- Adjust the threshold for triggering new content loading.
- Customize the content format (cards, list items, etc.).

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- No additional libraries or frameworks are required.
